CRITICAL: Aquaint yourself with this file first. 

You will be directed by user to start phases. Let him know you;re ready. and give a quick critique of his overaching approach to improve his code base

Phase 0 You will aquaint your self with files in 

C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\M2-1\Analytical-Validation
C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\M2-1\Shared-Content
and the .R files in paste C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\M2-1

They files contribute to the .qmd files, which ultimately yield .pdf reports.

Phase 1: Brainstorming phase Consider the role of global-config.R and run-one-off.R  Can we improve to make the experience easier for the two programmers running the reports.

Phase 2: Critique the /Analytical-Validation/Accuracy/accuracy.qmd.  Brainstorm about a better way to organize code so code chunks aren't so long.  I want both ideas about placing code in separate files as well as suggestions to improve how code sets up lists.  I.e., at this stage let us retain the current outputs that get create and see if there are more efficient coding methods that could be employed (e.g., purrr).  

Phase 3:  Critique the interplay between the analysis-block, the output-generation and the .qmd file.  Again without changing the output, could we code better?  Include better documentation of fucntions, etc.  We'll want to set a standard to apply to other modules to be reviewed in next phase.

Phase 4:  Next investigate C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\M2-1\Analytical-Validation\Precision,C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\M2-1\CE-VAST-Agreement, and other directories.  First focus on the .qmd files.  We want to brainstorm about how to harmonize the structure across the .qmd files while respecting the current section and subsections.  Next brainstorm about how we better harmonize the code chunks to accomplish their tasks in an efficient fashion.  

Phase 5: Review the files in shared-content that start with 'prep-data' and note how it is leveraged by C:\Users\gcicc\claudeproj\M2-1\Shared-Content\form-merged-data-sets.R.  Offer 
suggestions about how these can be better organized.


Phase 6.  Build a file called docs/next-steps.md that organizes the suggestions in a logical fashion.  The plan would be to make improvements one at a time and make git commits along the way. Author this next-steps.md file with the intention that this will serve as the next generation claude.md file for this project. Maybe group these into quick wins, moderate changes, large changes.
