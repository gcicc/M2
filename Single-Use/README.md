The essential difference to programs in GitHub ThresholdsModelsGeneral is that 
- various response functions are available (not only normal) and can be appended by the user,
- difficulty functions are separate functions.

Two applications are included:

RespTimeRotation (see Tutz & Jordan)

affectdataMair (see Tutz & Jordan)
